Since I am training this model on my MacBook Pro, it would take me days if I used the whole dataset. For this reason, I am only going to use a subset of the data, so that I can train it over night. Normally I use [FloydHub's](https://www.floydhub.com/) services for my GPU needs, but it would take quite a bit of time to upload the dataset and ConceptNet Numberbatch, so I'm not going to bother with that for this project.

I chose not use use the start of the subset because I didn't want to make it too easy for my model. The texts that I am using are closer to the median lengths; I thought this would be more fair.

- Summary(3): love it

**My Examples  (model 150k)**
- Review(1): I am not a big fan of cereal but it is nice to have it at the house.  Both my husband and my kid likes this.  I personally prefer protein shake for breakfast.
- Original summary(1): Family likes it
- My Summary(1): very nice breakfast cereal
---
- Original Text(2): Good value for a lot of treats! my dog absolutely loves these and it's awesome that they sell them on amazon for half the price of what they would sell it for at a pet store! Will continue buying from here as long as they're available :)
- Original summary(2): good value!
- My Summary(2): awesome value
---
- Original Text(3): My baby seems to prefer this formula mixture over the other bigger brands. If you buy it "Subscribe and Save" it's a lot cheaper, which is nice. I breastfed for 9 months until my baby stopped gaining weight so we had to start giving her formula. She's been growing steadily ever since!
- Original summary(3): Seems healthy, and my baby prefers it
- My Summary(3): great formula for baby
---
- Original Text(4): These are so good, especially when they are still hot.  I love the way they still sizzle and pop while eating.  Sometimes I sprinkle some hot sauce on mine straight from the microwave or a little parmesan cheese, depending on my mood.  However I eat them, they are really good.  Remember to shake them well for a minute or two before nuking them.  The bags do not puff up as much as microwave popcorn, so don't expect them to.  Only cook for the suggested time on the bag.
- Original summary(4): Yummmy!
- My Summary(4) : good stuff
---
- Original Text(5): IF YOU WANT A HIGH ENERGY, AND GREAT TASTING (AND I MEAN THE VERY BEST)ENERGY DRINKS, THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU! BEVNET.COM SAYS IT TASTES LIKE MOUNTAIN DEW, AND IT DOES! VOTED BEST TASTING! HAS JIFFY INGREDIENT THAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT CALLED D-RIBOSE, AND IT IS A SIMPLE SUGAR THAT IS GREAT FOR ATHLETES! NO BAD THINGS HERE. I HAD A BAD BATCH ONCE, BUT IT WAS A FLUKE.
- Original summary(5): THESE ARE THE BEST!
- My Summary(5) : the best energy drink

- Original Text(6): What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them. Highly recommended!
- Original summary(6): Great product!

- Original Text(7): When I was growing up, we ate a fair amount of Spam.  Every so often, I revisit those days, by purchasing some Spam and trying to enjoy it. And I think of the old Monty Python segment focusing on Spam. . . .<br /><br />It's not so easy for me to enjoy! Plain Spam, even cooked, doesn't do it for me.  I start out with good intentions of eating it as part of a meal and normally throw quite a bit of it out. So, this time around, I tried something different--a fried Spam sandwich.<br /><br />I cut up and fried some shallots, slathered a couple pieces of bread with Dijon mustard and catsup, and melted some American cheese over the Spam.  And it worked! This time, I successfully fixed something that didn't feature the Spam taste.  The result was an enjoyable sandwich.<br /><br />So, instead of throwing out all the Spam (as has happened in the past), I'm going to use my imagination this time in preparing this for a meal. In the past, this would have rated 1 to 2 stars; this time around, I'll give it three.
- Original summary(7): Back to the future with Spam
- Response Words(7): not the best

- Original Text(8): My dog absolutely loves these treats, and the price on these was nearly 1/2 the price I pay at the pet or grocery store!!! Plus I don't have to worry about running out for quite a while, or shall I say my dog does not have to worry!!
- Original summary(8): Great deal!
- Response Words(8): dog loves these

- Original Text(9): These Ziggies are great to stuff the Kong.  My dog hates his crate, so it keeps him very busy trying to get it out.<br />Sometimes it takes him hours.
- Original summary(9): Great item

- Original Text(10): Got some matcha in Japan from the airport and it was surprisingly tasty.  Still, you are told not to steep green tea for more than a couple minutes or else the bitter flavor comes out.  So, with matcha it's just gonna happen, since you can't take out the tea bag.<br /><br />That said, the Japan matcha was more granular than a "powder", more like sand really, and did not produce much bitterness even after ten minutes in hot water.  This Taiwan tea by comparison is a true powder.  It is difficult to dissolve, clumping a quite a bit, and produces a flavor that within a few minutes in hot water becomes bitter, then later even more bitter.<br /><br />UPDATE: It turns out you use a lot less of it than you do of the Japanese matcha I had.  The powder, since it is so fine, goes much further.  To help you with this, they have a spoon in the box to right-size the servings.  I was using a much larger teaspoon instead previously.  Using the smaller amount, it works great for hot tea and does not become bitter.
- Original summary(10): Price is OK, flavor a bit bitter
- Response Words(10): not as good as i hoped

- Original Tex(11)t: Oh, this is some good cat food!<br />Have you ever opened a can of Friskies and gagged at the awful smell? How can your cat eat that?<br />This cat food smells pretty good, and it simply looks and smells like good food. My kittens made so much noise when I opened that can! They gobbled it right up, and I have to admit that it smelled pretty good.
- Original summary(11): Exceptional Cat Food!
- Response Words(11): smells good

- Original Text(12): Hmm, at first, I thought this was another one of those beverages competing with Red Bull.  However, as soon as I had my first sip, I knew I was in for something healthier.<br /><br />Hmmm...healthy vs. energy boost?  That is the question of the day.<br /><br />The Switch contains 100% fruit juice and none of the other stuff.  It's just carbonated juice.<br /><br />However, I didn't really quite catch that 'black cherry' flavor.  It tasted more like apple juice than anything else.  Nonetheless, it was still good!
- Original summary(12): carbonated juice
- Response Words(12): not like cherry

- Original Text: First let me say that these beans taste just fine, however, there are way too many damaged beans in each tin and we were not expecting that.
- Original summary: A little disappointed
- Response Words: darker beans

- Original Text: The reviews were what sold me on trying this product & the ones I read raved about the taste, so I thought someone should tell the truth.  I'm an avid coffee drinker, so I just wasn't ready for what I found.  It was horrible!!!
- Original summary: Horrible taste!!!!!!!
-  Response Words: worst coffee i have ever tried so

- Original Text: I bought this to serve after I picked some blueberries.  This dessert was a huge hit!  Not to sweet, cooks in 1/2 hour and is good hot or cold.  Also the box is so cute I gave it to my kids teachers as a gift!  They loved it!  Just like homemade.

"""## Summary

I hope that you found this project to be rather interesting and informative. One of my main recommendations for working with this dataset and model is either use a GPU, a subset of the dataset, or plenty of time to train your model. As you might be able to expect, the model will not be able to make good predictions just by seeing many reviews, it needs so see the reviews many times to be able to understand the relationship between words and between descriptions & summaries. 

In short, I'm pleased with how well this model performs. After creating numerous reviews and checking those from the dataset, I can happily say that most of the generated summaries are appropriate, some of them are great, and some of them make mistakes. I'll try to improve this model and if it gets better, I'll update my GitHub.

Thanks for reading!
